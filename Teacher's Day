 teachers 
 why did you become one?
 i wonder,
 was it because of the red marks you could make?
 the satisfation that you completed your childhood's dream?
 or your lifelong aspiration?
 there are so many possibilities why,
 and with that,
 many opportunities were opened up for us.
 every insult, and every work you throw at us
 was it really so that we could improve for the better?
 But now i really know,
 that it was to bring the best out of us,
 So that we can have brighter and better childhoods and future than you could ever have.
 selflessly giving us help
 while we complain about workloads of homework,
 you mark every single piece, 36 in total, thro the night.
 how heroic and admirable can that be?
 because i know that, 
 you are our teacher, 
 that will never give up on us.
 Stepping into class everyday, 
 puttig up with all our nonsense
 i much appreciate the effort you have put,
 to make smarter with every next day
 Thank you teachers for all you've done,
 I can never thank you enough.
